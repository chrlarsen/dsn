# Stack Overflow 2017 Developer Survey Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook `notebook.ipynb` dedicated to exploring and drawing insights from the Stack Overflow 2017 Developer Survey dataset.

## Overview

The Stack Overflow Developer Survey provides a rich snapshot of the global developer community. This notebook aims to:

* **Uncover trends:**  Examine salary patterns, technology preferences, career satisfaction, and more.
* **Answer questions:** Investigate the factors that influence developer salaries, preferred technologies for different experience levels, and common challenges faced by developers.
* **Visualize results:**  Present findings in clear, informative charts and graphs.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2017, which can be found here: [https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017)

## Conclusions

I found the following three conclusions in my analysis:
1. Developers are increasingly using multiple programming languages.
2. Developers are more interested in learning new technologies than ever before.
3. Developers are facing a number of challenges, including burnout and discrimination.
